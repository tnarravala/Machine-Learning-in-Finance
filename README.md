# Machine-Learning-in-Finance

Here I have saved the work I learnt from the theory and practice of supervised and reinforcement learning to big data problems in finance. I have learnt the various mathematical frameworks for applying machine learning in quantitative finance such as factor modeling with supervised learning and optimal investment with reinforcement learning. Neural networks are used to implement many of these mathematical frameworks in finance using real market data.

Here are few thing I have accomplishments,

1. I have learnt the fundamentals of statistical learning theory
2. I have learnt the basics of Neural Networks for point estimation from financial data 
3. I have learnt the basics of Reinforcement Learning for optimal stochastic control problems in finance
4. I have gained hands on experience working with real market data and implementing machine learning methods in Python.
